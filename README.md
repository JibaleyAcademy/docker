## Getting Started with Docker
Docker is a platform designed to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers allow developers to package applications with all their dependencies, ensuring consistent performance across environments.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Linux and the command line.
- Installed Docker Engine: [Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Familiarity with virtualization concepts is a plus.

## Best Practices for Docker
1. **Use Official Images**
   - Base your containers on official or well-maintained images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

2. **Keep Images Lightweight**
   - Use minimal base images like `alpine` to reduce size and improve performance.
   - Example:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM alpine:latest
     ```

3. **Optimize Dockerfile**
   - Combine `RUN` commands to reduce layers.
   - Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
   - Example:
     ```dockerfile
     # Bad
     RUN apt-get update
     RUN apt-get install -y curl

     # Good
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
     ```

4. **Leverage Multi-Stage Builds**
   - Build and deploy in separate stages to keep the final image clean.
   - Example:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM golang:1.19 AS builder
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY . .
     RUN go build -o app

     FROM alpine:latest
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY --from=builder /app/app .
     CMD ["./app"]
     ```

5. **Use Environment Variables**
   - Use `ENV` in Dockerfiles for configuration, and `docker-compose.yml` for secrets.

6. **Health Checks**
   - Add `HEALTHCHECK` to monitor container health.
   - Example:
     ```dockerfile
     HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8080/ || exit 1
     ```

7. **Limit Container Privileges**
   - Use non-root users whenever possible.
   - Example:
     ```dockerfile
     RUN adduser -D myuser
     USER myuser
     ```

8. **Persist Data Correctly**
   - Use volumes to persist data.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     docker run -v myvolume:/data myimage
     ```

9. **Regularly Update Images**
   - Keep dependencies and images updated to address vulnerabilities.

10. **Log Management**
    - Configure centralized logging using Dockerâ€™s logging drivers or external tools.
